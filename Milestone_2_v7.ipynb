    "\n",
    "We are aware that you have little time this week, due to the midterm. So this milestone is a bit easier to achieve than the others. The goal for this week is to prepare the data for the modeling phase of the project. You should end up with a typical data setup of training data X and data labels Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact form of X and Y depends on the ideas you had previously. In general though Y should involve the genre of a movie, and X the features you want to include to predict the genre. Remember from the lecture that more features does not necessarily equal better prediction performance. Use your application knowledge and the insight you gathered from your genre pair analysis and additional EDA to design Y. Do you want to include all genres? Are there genres that you assume to be easier to separate than others? Are there genres that could be grouped together? There is no one right answer here. We are looking for your insight, so be sure to describe your decision process in your notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation for the deep learning part we strongly encourage you to have two sets of training data X, one with the metadata and one with the movie posters. Make sure to have a common key, like the movie ID, to be able to link the two sets together. Also be mindful of the data rate when you obtain the posters. Time your requests and choose which poster resolution you need. In most cases w500 should be sufficient, and probably a lower resolution will be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook to submit this week should at least include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discussion about the imbalanced nature of the data and how you want to address it\n",
    "- Description of your data\n",
    "- What does your choice of Y look like?\n",
    "- Which features do you choose for X and why? \n",
    "- How do you sample your data, how many samples, and why?\n",

    "The desired response variable is a reflection of the genre of the movie.  Unfortunately, the data as obtained from TMDB has one to four different genres assigned to each movie.  Concatenating the genres together without modification would result in a very significant number of classes (thousands of potential classes), more than would be practical given the quantity of data available and the time constraints of the project.  As such, we have explored a few techniques to reduce the number of genres suitable for this project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first approach reduced the movies by the first genre listed, which resulted in twenty classes.  This reduction seemed a bit simplistic, so we chose to examine the genre correlations and apply heuristics to the data.  The infrequent genres were manually mapped to more common where it made intuitive sense, and correlations of the genres were examined to effectively creating a reduced number of classes, 149.  The resultant classes do include the general categories and specifics, such as \"Action\" and \"Crime/Action\", but every movie is uniquely mapped to a single class of genre tuples.  Approximately 107 of the 149 classes (72%) have very low frequencies (8% of the data) can be categorized as \"Other\". \n",

    "There are a number of sampling techniques that were considered.  The simplest approach is a random sample, however due to the imbalanced nature of the data would likely focus on the few dominant classes disregarding the minority classes.  We have considered oversampling the data which would repeatedly sample the minority classes to equalize class imbalance, undersampling which would effectively ignore some data in the majority classes, synthetic data generation which was dismissed as it would be intuitively difficult to generate, and stratified sampling with class weights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified sampling preserves the class structure when performing sampling, by sampling a number of observations relative to the overall class proportion from the distinct classes, namely with the assigned genres forming the strata.  As such, any sample of the data will maintain the relative class frequencies present in the original, complete dataset.  Additionally, the class proportions (weights) are known from the overall dataset (and honored in the sample) and thus can be used to adjust for the imbalance of the classes with machine learning algorithms.\n",
