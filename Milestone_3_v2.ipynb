    "### Milestone 3: Traditional statistical and machine learning methods, due Wednesday, April 19, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how you would address the genre prediction problem with traditional statistical or machine learning methods. This includes everything you learned about modeling in this course before the deep learning part. Implement your ideas and compare different classifiers. Report your results and discuss what challenges you faced and how you overcame them. What works and what does not? If there are parts that do not work as expected, make sure to discuss briefly what you think is the cause and how you would address this if you would have more time and resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "You do not necessarily need to use the movie posters for this step, but even without a background in computer vision, there are very simple features you can extract from the posters to help guide a traditional machine learning model. Think about the PCA lecture for example, or how to use clustering to extract color information. In addition to considering the movie posters it would be worthwhile to have a look at the metadata that IMDb provides. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could use Spark and the [ML library](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#word2vec) to build your model features from the data. This may be especially beneficial if you use additional data, e.g., in text form.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to think about how you are going to evaluate your classifier. Which metrics or scores will you report to show how good the performance is?\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook to submit this week should at least include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detailed description and implementation of two different models\n",
    "- Description of your performance metrics\n",
    "- Careful performance evaluations for both models\n",
    "- Visualizations of the metrics for performance evaluation\n",
    "- Discussion of the differences between the models, their strengths, weaknesses, etc. \n",
    "- Discussion of the performances you achieved, and how you might be able to improve them in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preliminary Peer Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to provide positive feedback to people who truly worked hard for the good of the team and to also make suggestions to those you perceived not to be working as effectively on team tasks. We ask you to provide an honest assessment of the contributions of the members of your team, including yourself. The feedback you provide should reflect your judgment of each team member’s:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preparation – were they prepared during team meetings?\n",
    "- Contribution – did they contribute productively to the team discussion and work?\n",
    "- Respect for others’ ideas – did they encourage others to contribute their ideas?\n",
    "- Flexibility – were they flexible when disagreements occurred?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your teammate’s assessment of your contributions and the accuracy of your self-assessment will be considered as part of your overall project score.\n",

    "We actually created three different model for this model. We started with a random forest model and a svm to train as a multiclass classifier. But as we were working through the process, we had an hypothesis that the problem actually might make more sense as a multi label problem. Our third model was a multilabel model with OneVSrest Randomforest classifier.\n",
    "We went explore a few sets of different features (budgets, revenues, studio, and ect) and ultimately settled on using \"revenue\" + features extracted directly from the poster. We created 8 news features from the poster's extracting the top 5 dominant colors of each poster, and calculated the color intensity (by summing r,b,g values horizontally) and averaging red, blue, and green scale (by averaging r,b,g value vertically). We figured since the final deliverable will heavily involve the posters, we though we tried to use some features from the posters in ms 3 as well, so we'll have a benchmark for later."
